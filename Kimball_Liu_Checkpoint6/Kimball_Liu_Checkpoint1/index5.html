                    <p>Manga is a Japanese term used for describing comics that are read from right-to-left. 
						The origin of these comics can be dated back as far as the 11th century in Japan and 
						slowly became influenced by Western culture. In Japan, both the comics and text are read
						from right-to-left; however, translating and distributing these books in America can be
						confusing to unaccustomed readers. Most manga brought over to the US would be considered
						a backwards book; the pages are read from right-to-left and so are the panels within
						those pages. However, the text within those panels are read from left-to-right like most
						traditional English books.

					<p>The tradition of narrative art or telling stories with a series of sequential images 
						has been a part of Japanese culture long before Superman ever put on a cape. The earliest 
						examples of pre-manga artwork that influenced the development of modern Japanese comics 
						are commonly attributed to Toba Sojo, an 11th-century painter-priest with a whimsical sense 
						of humor.
					</p>
					<p>Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga, animal-person caricatures, and Shigisan-engi, a chronicle of stories 
						following a Buddhist monk, are emakimono or painted handscrolls.While there are no word 
						balloons or sound effects in Toba’s paintings, they do show a progression of events, 
						happening one after another as the scroll is unrolled from right to left. However, some 
						writers believe that these pieces of art should be considered a masterpiece and not placed 
						in the same category as comic books.</p>

					<p>In the 16th and 17th century, a new art style using wood blocks emerged and became 
						popular for depicting scenes of escape and fantasies in the red-light district. Ukiyo-e 
						translates to the floating world, which was used to refer to teahouses, theaters, 
						restaurants and high-class brothels, were woodblock printings that were sometimes made 
						into books. Soon after ukiyo-e was introduced, akahon, Red Book, was produced for children 
						that consisted of Japanese folktales and were later produced for adults as well due to 
						popularity. These woodblock printed books were referred to as kusazoshi, which was a term 
						used for various genres of illustrated literature, akahon being one type..</p>
					</div>	
					<div class="paragraph2">	
						<p>In 1814 the first use of the word “manga” was used so by an ukiyo-e artist. Katsushika 
						Hokusai called his collection of works Hokusai Manga which was a 15 volume collection of 
						woodblock printings, however, the term manga meaning whimsical drawings, does not relate 
						to the same use in modern days. These ukiyo-e pieces were separate illustrations that told 
						a story unto themselves and did not consist of sequential storytelling.</p>

					<p>Printed in book form using woodblock technology, kibyôshi ("yellow covers") were 
						storybooks for adults in which narration and dialogue were placed in and around 
						ink-brush illustrations, often in creative ways that consciously blurred the distinction 
						between text and picture. (Multi-volume kibyôshi were known as gôkan.) Like modern-day 
						manga, they dealt with a variety of subjects, including humor, drama, fantasy, and even 
						pornography.</p>
						<p>As trade began to grow in Japan, there were magazines printed for Westerners in Japan. 
						Charles Wirgman, an English cartoonist, produced a magazine for Westerners called, 
						“Japan Punch,” which contained local news and cartoon strips. When Japan was opened to the 
						outside world, European artists introduced shading, perspective and anatomy. They also 
						introduced word balloons and separate sequences. Also, new printing techniques were 
						introduced at this time that were more efficent than woodblock prints. Under European 
						influence, Japanese started making humor magazines similar to Punch, the most famous of 
						which was Marumaru Shinbun in 1877.</p>
						<p>Since these comics and magazines could be purchased at such a low cost, they were 
						affordable to the masses and thus began to boom in popularity. Over time the topics of 
						these comics moved towards poking fun at the Japanese government and thus political 
						propaganda through comics became a way to voice public opinions.</p>

					<p>But during the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Japanese government started 
						intimidating artists and publishers. Many magazines either closed or started censoring 
						themselves harshly; magazines who did neither frequently had their editors arrested. 
						These types of arrests happened so often that magazines would sometimes pick an employee 
						to be a "jail editor" who would have the honor of taking the punishment and saving his 
						company.</p>
					<p>Many were forced into tenkou, or a sort of forced conversion. Those who cooperated 
						were greatly rewarded, and those who didn't cooperate were punished with detentions, 
						ostracized and forbidden to write. During the war, cartoonists would produce three 
						basic types of strips: single-panel strips about Japan's enemies, family comic strips 
						that portrayed home life during a war, and propaganda.</p>

					<p>During World War II, manga was used for propaganda to instill values such as 
						sacrifice for the state and government. During this period of restricted creativity, 
						manga began to decline and many publishing companies were closed. </p>
					<p>After Japan’s surrender during World War II, creativity and manga began to slowly

						the “grandmother of manga,” published her popular series, Sazae-san. A male-dominated 
						industry probably also helped contribute to Hasagawa’s fame since she was the first

					<p>Years after World War II Osamu Tezuka single-handedly changed manga forever. 
						Instead of following the Western influenced 2D art style, he created his own style 
						of drawings that depicted three dimensions. With his technique to add cinematography 
						to his comics, the images popped out and appeared to have a liveliness to them. This 
						art style quickly grew and influenced much of the modern art in manga seen today.</p>
					<p>Tezuka's innovations led to a broadening of the manga market and had a consequence 
						that would inevitably force a radical restructuring of the market: the children who 
						were raised on the manga of Tezuka and his followers, unlike their predecessors, didn't 
						stop reading manga when they got to middle school. Or high school. Or college. Tezuka is 
						also the father of the large eyes style used in anime and manga. Through his innovative
						art style and narrative story producing for all genres, many artists were influenced and 
						thus the anime and manga movement exploded.</p>

					<p>1959, Weekly Shônen Magazine and Weekly Shônen Sunday became the first children's

						general education and entertainment magazines, with manga usually occupying no more 
						than forty percent of each issue. But circulations (hovering around 200,000) were low, 
						as were those of the traditional monthly children's magazines. It didn't take long, 
						however, for publishers to figure out that they could raise sales by increasing the 
						space dedicated to manga. Within a few years, manga came to occupy more than half of
