                            Manga is a Japanese term used for describing<br/> 
							comics that are read from right-to-left.<br/> 
                            The origin of these comics can be dated back <br/>
							as far as the 11th century in Japan and <br/>
                            slowly became influenced by Western culture.</p>
							<p id="desc2">In Japan, both the comics and text are read<br/>
                            from right-to-left; however, translating and <br/>
							distributing these books in America can be<br/>
                            confusing to unaccustomed readers.<br/>
							Most manga brought over to the US would <br/>
							be considered a backwards book; the pages<br/> 
							are read from right-to-left and so are the<br/>
							panels within those pages. However, the<br/>
							text within those panels are read from<br/> 
							left-to-right like most traditional English<br/> books.

									has been a part of Japanese culture long before Superman ever put on a cape. The earliest 
									examples of pre-manga artwork that influenced the development of modern Japanese comics 
									are commonly attributed to Toba Sojo, an 11th-century painter-priest with a whimsical sense 
									of humor.
									</p>
							
									<p id="desc4">Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga, animal-person caricatures, and Shigisan-engi, a chronicle of stories 
									following a Buddhist monk, are emakimono or painted handscrolls.While there are no word 
									balloons or sound effects in Toba’s paintings, they do show a progression of events, 
									happening one after another as the scroll is unrolled from right to left. However, some 
									writers believe that these pieces of art should be considered a masterpiece and not placed 
									in the same category as comic books.</p>

									<p>In the 16th and 17th century,
									a new art style using wood
									blocks emerged and became 
									popular for depicting scenes of escape and fantasies in the red-light district. 
									Ukiyo-e
									translates to the floating world, which was used to refer to teahouses, theaters, 
									restaurants and high-class brothels, were woodblock printings that were sometimes made 
									into <br />books.</p> 
									
									<p>Soon after ukiyo-e was introduced, akahon, Red Book, was produced for children 
									that consisted of Japanese folktales and were later produced for adults as well due to 
									popularity. These woodblock printed books were referred to as kusazoshi, which was a term 
									used for various genres of illustrated literature, akahon being one type.
									</p>
							
									<p>In 1814 the first use of the word “manga” was used so by an ukiyo-e artist. Katsushika 
									Hokusai called his collection of works Hokusai Manga which was a 15 volume collection of 
									woodblock printings, however, the term manga meaning whimsical drawings, does not relate 
									to the same use in modern days. These ukiyo-e pieces were separate illustrations that told 
									a story unto themselves and did not consist of sequential storytelling.

                                <p>Printed in book form using woodblock technology, kibyôshi ("yellow covers") were 
                                storybooks for adults in which narration and dialogue were placed in and around 
                                ink-brush illustrations, often in creative ways that consciously blurred the distinction 
                                between text and picture. (Multi-volume kibyôshi were known as gôkan.) Like modern-day 
                                manga, they dealt with a variety of subjects, including humor, drama, fantasy, and even 
                                pornography.
                                </p>
                        
                                <p>As trade began to grow in Japan, there were magazines printed for Westerners in Japan. 
                                Charles Wirgman, an English cartoonist, produced a magazine for Westerners called, 
                                “Japan Punch,” which contained local news and cartoon strips. When Japan was opened to the 
                                outside world, European artists introduced shading, perspective and anatomy. They also 
                                introduced word balloons and separate sequences. Also, new printing techniques were 
                                introduced at this time that were more efficent than woodblock prints. Under European 
                                influence, Japanese started making humor magazines similar to Punch, the most famous of 
                                which was Marumaru Shinbun in 1877.
                                </p>
                        
                                <p>Since these comics and magazines could be purchased at such a low cost, they were 
                                affordable to the masses and thus began to boom in popularity. Over time the topics of 
                                these comics moved towards poking fun at the Japanese government and thus political 
                                propaganda through comics became a way to voice public opinions.

                                <p>But during the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Japanese government started 
                                intimidating artists and publishers. Many magazines either closed or started censoring 
                                themselves harshly; magazines who did neither frequently had their editors arrested. 
                                These types of arrests happened so often that magazines would sometimes pick an employee 
                                to be a "jail editor" who would have the honor of taking the punishment and saving his 
                                company.
                                </p>
                        
                                <p>Many were forced into tenkou, or a sort of forced conversion. Those who cooperated 
                                were greatly rewarded, and those who didn't cooperate were punished with detentions, 
                                ostracized and forbidden to write. During the war, cartoonists would produce three 
                                basic types of strips: single-panel strips about Japan's enemies, family comic strips 
                                that portrayed home life during a war, and propaganda.

									<p>After Japan’s surrender during World War II, creativity and manga began to slowly

									the “grandmother of manga,” published her popular series, Sazae-san. A male-dominated

									<p>Years after World War II Osamu Tezuka single-handedly changed manga forever. 
									Instead of following the Western influenced 2D art style, he created his own style 
									of drawings that depicted three dimensions. With his technique to add cinematography 
									to his comics, the images popped out and appeared to have a liveliness to them. This 
									art style quickly grew and influenced much of the modern art in manga seen today.
									</p>
									<p>Tezuka's innovations led to a broadening of the manga market and had a consequence 
									that would inevitably force a radical restructuring of the market: the children who 
									were raised on the manga of Tezuka and his followers, unlike their predecessors, didn't 
									stop reading manga when they got to middle school. Or high school. Or college. Tezuka is 
									also the father of the large eyes style used in anime and manga. Through his innovative
									art style and narrative story producing for all genres, many artists were influenced and 
									thus the anime and manga movement exploded.
