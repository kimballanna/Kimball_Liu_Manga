                            <p>
                            Manga is a Japanese term used for describing comics that are read from right-to-left. 
                            The origin of these comics can be dated back as far as the 11th century in Japan and 
                            slowly became influenced by Western culture. In Japan, both the comics and text are read
                            from right-to-left; however, translating and distributing these books in America can be
                            confusing to unaccustomed readers. Most manga brought over to the US would be considered
                            a backwards book; the pages are read from right-to-left and so are the panels within
                            those pages. However, the text within those panels are read from left-to-right like most
                            traditional English books.
                            </p>

                                <p>The tradition of narrative art or telling stories with a series of sequential images 
                                has been a part of Japanese culture long before Superman ever put on a cape. The earliest 
                                examples of pre-manga artwork that influenced the development of modern Japanese comics 
                                are commonly attributed to Toba Sojo, an 11th-century painter-priest with a whimsical sense 
                                of humor.
                                </p>

                                following a Buddhist monk, are emakimono or painted handscrolls.While there are no word 
                                balloons or sound effects in Toba’s paintings, they do show a progression of events, 
                                happening one after another as the scroll is unrolled from right to left. However, some 
                                writers believe that these pieces of art should be considered a masterpiece and not placed 
                                in the same category as comic books.</p>

                                restaurants and high-class brothels, were woodblock printings that were sometimes made 
                                into books. Soon after ukiyo-e was introduced, akahon, Red Book, was produced for children 
                                that consisted of Japanese folktales and were later produced for adults as well due to 
                                popularity. These woodblock printed books were referred to as kusazoshi, which was a term 
                                used for various genres of illustrated literature, akahon being one type.
                                </p>
                        
                                <p>In 1814 the first use of the word “manga” was used so by an ukiyo-e artist. Katsushika 
                                Hokusai called his collection of works Hokusai Manga which was a 15 volume collection of 
                                woodblock printings, however, the term manga meaning whimsical drawings, does not relate 
                                to the same use in modern days. These ukiyo-e pieces were separate illustrations that told 
                                a story unto themselves and did not consist of sequential storytelling.

                                <p>Printed in book form using woodblock technology, kibyôshi ("yellow covers") were 
                                storybooks for adults in which narration and dialogue were placed in and around 
                                ink-brush illustrations, often in creative ways that consciously blurred the distinction 
                                between text and picture. (Multi-volume kibyôshi were known as gôkan.) Like modern-day 
                                manga, they dealt with a variety of subjects, including humor, drama, fantasy, and even 
                                pornography.
                                </p>
                        
                                <p>As trade began to grow in Japan, there were magazines printed for Westerners in Japan. 
                                Charles Wirgman, an English cartoonist, produced a magazine for Westerners called, 
                                “Japan Punch,” which contained local news and cartoon strips. When Japan was opened to the 
                                outside world, European artists introduced shading, perspective and anatomy. They also 
                                introduced word balloons and separate sequences. Also, new printing techniques were 
                                introduced at this time that were more efficent than woodblock prints. Under European 
                                influence, Japanese started making humor magazines similar to Punch, the most famous of 
                                which was Marumaru Shinbun in 1877.
                                </p>
                        
                                <p>Since these comics and magazines could be purchased at such a low cost, they were 
                                affordable to the masses and thus began to boom in popularity. Over time the topics of 
                                these comics moved towards poking fun at the Japanese government and thus political 
                                propaganda through comics became a way to voice public opinions.

                                <p>But during the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Japanese government started 
                                intimidating artists and publishers. Many magazines either closed or started censoring 
                                themselves harshly; magazines who did neither frequently had their editors arrested. 
                                These types of arrests happened so often that magazines would sometimes pick an employee 
                                to be a "jail editor" who would have the honor of taking the punishment and saving his 
                                company.
                                </p>
                        
                                <p>Many were forced into tenkou, or a sort of forced conversion. Those who cooperated 
                                were greatly rewarded, and those who didn't cooperate were punished with detentions, 
                                ostracized and forbidden to write. During the war, cartoonists would produce three 
                                basic types of strips: single-panel strips about Japan's enemies, family comic strips 
                                that portrayed home life during a war, and propaganda.

                                <p>During World War II, manga was used for propaganda to instill values such as 
                                sacrifice for the state and government. During this period of restricted creativity, 
                                manga began to decline and many publishing companies were closed. 
                                </p>

                                <p>After Japan’s surrender during World War II, creativity and manga began to slowly 
                                return and another important figure behind manga emerged. Machiko Hasegawa, known as 
                                the “grandmother of manga,” published her popular series, Sazae-san. A male-dominated 
                                industry probably also helped contribute to Hasagawa’s fame since she was the first 
                                female manga artist.

                                <p>Years after World War II Osamu Tezuka single-handedly changed manga forever. 
                                Instead of following the Western influenced 2D art style, he created his own style 
                                of drawings that depicted three dimensions. With his technique to add cinematography 
                                to his comics, the images popped out and appeared to have a liveliness to them. This 
                                art style quickly grew and influenced much of the modern art in manga seen today.
                                </p>
                                <p>Tezuka's innovations led to a broadening of the manga market and had a consequence 
                                that would inevitably force a radical restructuring of the market: the children who 
                                were raised on the manga of Tezuka and his followers, unlike their predecessors, didn't 
                                stop reading manga when they got to middle school. Or high school. Or college. Tezuka is 
                                also the father of the large eyes style used in anime and manga. Through his innovative
                                art style and narrative story producing for all genres, many artists were influenced and 
                                thus the anime and manga movement exploded.

                                <p>1959, Weekly Shônen Magazine and Weekly Shônen Sunday became the first children's 
                                weeklies, and others soon followed. Initially, these magazines were conceived of as 
                                general education and entertainment magazines, with manga usually occupying no more 
                                than forty percent of each issue. But circulations (hovering around 200,000) were low, 
                                as were those of the traditional monthly children's magazines. It didn't take long, 
                                however, for publishers to figure out that they could raise sales by increasing the 
                                space dedicated to manga. Within a few years, manga came to occupy more than half of 
                                the total space.
